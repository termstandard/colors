# Terminal Colors

_(Previously published and discussed at https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728.)_

There exists common confusion about terminal colors. This is what we have right now:

- Plain ASCII
- ANSI escape codes: 16 color codes with bold/italic and background
- 256 color palette: 216 colors + 16 ANSI + 24 gray (colors are 24-bit)
- 24-bit truecolor: "888" colors (aka 16 million)

```bash
printf "\x1b[${bg};2;${red};${green};${blue}m\n"
```

The 256-color palette is configured at start and is a 666-cube of colors,
each of them defined as a 24-bit (888 RGB) color.

This means that current support can only display 256 different colors in the
terminal while "truecolor" means that you can display 16 million different
colors at the same time.

Truecolor escape codes do not use a color palette. They just specify the
color directly.

For a quick check of your terminal, run:

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

which will print <span style="color:#ff6400">TRUECOLOR</span> in brown if it
understands Xterm-style true-color escapes.

For a more thorough test, run:

```sh
awk 'BEGIN{
    s="/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\"; s=s s s s s s s s;
    for (colnum = 0; colnum<77; colnum++) {
        r = 255-(colnum*255/76);
        g = (colnum*510/76);
        b = (colnum*255/76);
        if (g>255) g = 510-g;
        printf "\033[48;2;%d;%d;%dm", r,g,b;
        printf "\033[38;2;%d;%d;%dm", 255-r,255-g,255-b;
        printf "%s\033[0m", substr(s,colnum+1,1);
    }
    printf "\n";
}'
```

```bash
# if you trust them, run them

Keep in mind that it is possible to use both ';' and ':' as Control Sequence
delimiters.

According to Wikipedia[1], this behavior is only supported by xterm and konsole.

# Truecolor Detection

## Checking for COLORTERM

[VTE](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=754521),
[Konsole](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=371919) and
[iTerm2](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5294) all advertise
truecolor support by placing `COLORTERM=truecolor` in the environment of the
shell user's shell. This has been in VTE for a while, but is relatively new in
Konsole and iTerm2 and has to be enabled at compile time (most packages do not,
so you have to compile them yourself from the git source repo).

The S-Lang library has a check that `$COLORTERM` contains either "truecolor" or
"24bit" (case sensitive).

Terminfo has supported the 24-bit TrueColor capability since
[ncurses-6.0-20180121](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2018-01/msg00045.html),
under the name "RGB".
You need to use the "setaf" and "setab" commands to set the foreground and
background respectively.

Having an extra environment variable (separate from `TERM`) is not ideal: by
default it is not forwarded via sudo, ssh, etc, and so it may still be
unreliable even where support is available in programs. (It does however err on
the side of safety: it does not advertise support when it is not actually
supported, and the programs should fall back to using 8-bit color.)

These issues can be ameliorated by adding `COLORTERM` to:
* the `SendEnv` list in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` on ssh clients;
* the `AcceptEnv` list in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on ssh servers; and
* the `env_keep` list in `/etc/sudoers`.

Despite these problems, it's currently the best option, so checking
`$COLORTERM` is recommended since it will lead to a more seamless desktop
experience where only one variable needs to be set.

App developers can freely choose to check for this variable, or introduce their
own method (e.g. an option in their config file). They should use whichever
method best matches the overall design of their app.

Ideally any terminal that really supports truecolor would set this variable;
but as a work-around you might need to put a check in `/etc/profile` to set
`COLORTERM=truecolor` when `$TERM` matches any terminal type known to have
working truecolor.

```lang=sh
case $TERM in
  iterm            |\
  linux-truecolor  |\
  screen-truecolor |\
  tmux-truecolor   |\
  xterm-truecolor  )    export COLORTERM=truecolor ;;
  vte*)
esac
```

## Querying The Terminal

In an interactive program that can read terminal responses, a more reliable
method is available, that is transparent to sudo & ssh.

Simply try sending a truecolor value to the terminal, followed by a query to
ask what color it currently has. If the response indicates the same color as
was just set, then truecolor is supported.

If the response indicates an 8-bit color, or does not indicate a color, or if
no response is forthcoming within a few centiseconds, then assume that
truecolor is not supported.

```bash
$ ( printf '\e[48:2:1:2:3m\eP$qm\e\\' ; xxd -g1 )

^[P1$r48:2:1:2:3m^[\
00000000: 1b 50 31 24 72 34 38 3a 32 3a 31 3a 32 3a 33 6d  .P1$r48:2:1:2:3m
```

Here we set the background color to `RGB(1,2,3)` - an unlikely default
choice - and request the value that we just set. The response comes back that
the request was understood (`1`), and that the color is indeed `48:2:1:2:3`.
This tells us also that the terminal supports the colon delimiter. If instead,
the terminal did not support truecolor we might see a response like

```
^[P1$r40m^[\
00000000: 1b 50 31 24 72 34 30 6d 1b 5c 0a              .P1$r40m.\.
```


This terminal replied that the color is `40` - it has not accepted our request
to set `48:2:1:2:3`.

```
^[P0$r^[\
00000000: 1b 50 30 24 72 1b 5c 0a                      .P0$r.\.
```

This terminal did not even understand the `DECRQSS` request - its response was
`CSI`+`0$r`. This does not indicate whether it set the color, but since it
doesn't understand how to reply to our request it is unlikely to support
truecolor either.

### Multiplexers

- [dvtm](https://github.com/martanne/dvtm) - not yet supporting truecolor https://github.com/martanne/dvtm/issues/10
- [pymux](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pymux) - tmux clone in pure Python (to enable truecolor run pymux with `--truecolor` option)
- [screen](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/) - has support in 'master' branch, need to be enabled (see 'truecolor' option)
- [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) - starting from version 2.2 (support since [427b820...](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/427b8204268af5548d09b830e101c59daa095df9))

### Re-players

- [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) player:
  https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player

## Partial Support

These terminal emulators parse ANSI color sequences, but approximate the true
color using a palette or limit number of true colors that can be used at the
same time. A 256-color (8-bit) palette is used unless specified.

- Linux console ([fbcon](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/fb/fbcon.html)), [since v3.16](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cec5b2a97a11ade56a701e83044d0a2a984c67b4) - https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79551 (downgraded to 16 foregrounds and 8 backgrounds)
- [mlterm](http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/) - built with **--with-gtk=3.0** configure flag. Approximates colors using a 512-color embedded palette (https://sourceforge.net/p/mlterm/bugs/74/)
- [urxvt aka rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) - since [revision 1.570](http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/src/command.C?revision=1.570&view=markup&sortby=log&sortdir=down). Limits maximum number of colors: http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/rxvt-unicode/2016q2/002261.html

#### Note about color differences

Human eyes are sensitive to the primary colors in such a way that the simple
Gaussian distance √(R²+G²+B²) gives poor results when trying to find the
"nearest" available color as perceived by most humans.

The [CIEDE2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000)
formula provides much better perceptual matching, but it is considerably more
complex and may perform very slowly if used blindly [2].
