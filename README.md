# Terminal Colours

There exists common confusion about terminal colours. This is what we have right now:

- Plain ASCII
- ANSI escape codes: 16 colour codes with bold/italic and background
- 256 colour palette: 216 colours + 16 ANSI + 24 gray (colors are 24-bit)
- 24-bit true colour: "888" colours (aka 16 milion)

```
printf "\x1b[${bg};2;${red};${green};${blue}m\n"
```

The 256-colour palette is configured at start and is a 666-cube of colours,
each of them defined as a 24-bit (888 rgb) colour.

This means that current support can only display 256 different colours in the
terminal while "TrueColour" means that you can display 16 million different
colours at the same time.

Truecolour escape codes do not use a colour palette. They just specify the
colour itself.

This is a good test case:

```
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

- or
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnMorales/dotfiles/master/colors/24-bit-color.sh
- or http://github.com/robertknight/konsole/tree/master/tests/color-spaces.pl
- or https://git.gnome.org/browse/vte/tree/perf/img.sh
- or just run this:

```sh
awk 'BEGIN{
    s="/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\"; s=s s s s s s s s;
    for (colnum = 0; colnum<77; colnum++) {
        r = 255-(colnum*255/76);
        g = (colnum*510/76);
        b = (colnum*255/76);
        if (g>255) g = 510-g;
        printf "\033[48;2;%d;%d;%dm", r,g,b;
        printf "\033[38;2;%d;%d;%dm", 255-r,255-g,255-b;
        printf "%s\033[0m", substr(s,colnum+1,1);
    }
    printf "\n";
}'
```

Keep in mind that it is possible to use both ';' and ':' as Control Sequence
Introducer delimiters.

According to Wikipedia[1], this behavior is only supported by xterm and konsole.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_color

Since
[ncurses-6.0-20180121](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2018-01/msg00045.html),
terminfo began to support the 24-bit TrueColour capability under the name of
"RGB". You need to use the "setaf" and "setab" commands to set the foreground 
and background respectively.

# TrueColour Detection

There will be no reliable way to detect the "RGB" flag until the new release of
terminfo/ncurses. S-Lang author added a check for $COLORTERM containing either
"truecolor" or "24bit" (case sensitive). In addition,
[VTE](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=754521),
[Konsole](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=371919) and
[iTerm2](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5294) set this variable to
"truecolor". It has been in VTE for a while and but is relatively new, being
still git-only in Konsole and iTerm2).

This is obviously not a reliable method, and is not forwarded via sudo, SSH etc.
However, whenever it errs, it errs on the safe side. It does not advertise
support when it is actually supported. App developers can freely choose to
check for this same variable, or introduce their own method (e.g. an option in
their config file). They should use whichever method best matches the overall
design of their app. Checking $COLORTERM is recommended though since it will
lead to a more seamless desktop experience where only one variable needs to be
set. This would be system-wide so that the user would not need to set it
separately for each app.

There are a bunch of libvte-based terminals for GTK2, so they are listed in the
another section.

Also, while this one is not a terminal, but a terminal replayer, it is
still worth mentioning:

- [asciinema](http://asciinema.org) player:
  https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player

## Improper Support for TrueColour

- [mlterm](http://mlterm.sourceforge.net) - built with **--with-gtk=3.0**
  configure flag. Approximates colors to 512 embedded palette
  (https://sourceforge.net/p/mlterm/bugs/74/)

## Terminals that parse ANSI colour sequences, but approximate them to 256 palette

- xterm (but doing it wrong: "it uses nearest colour in RGB colour space,
  with a usualfalse assumption about orthogonal axes")
- [urxvt aka rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) -
  since
  [Revision 1.570](http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/src/command.C?revision=1.570&view=markup&sortby=log&sortdir=down)
  http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/rxvt-unicode/2016q2/002261.html (Note there
  is a restriction of colors count still)
- linux console (since v3.16):
  https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cec5b2a97a11ade56a701e83044d0a2a984c67b4

Note about colour differences: 
a) RGB axes are not orthogonal, so you cannot use
sqrt(R^2+G^2+B^2) formula
b) for colour differences there is more correct (but
much more complex)
[CIEDE2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000) formula
(which may easily blow up performance if used blindly) [2].
